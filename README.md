My completed assignments for 
[Berkeley CS 285: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse-fa21/), 
the fall 2021 semester.

The repo was forked from https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework_fall2021. 
The original repo only contains the starter code. The code are all completed 
in this repo by my own in this repo.
